  I create a supplier invoice
-
  !record {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_supplier_refunded, view: account.invoice_supplier_form}:
    check_total: 600.00
    partner_id: base.res_partner_12
    reference_type: none
    type: in_invoice
    account_id: account.a_pay
    company_id: base.main_company
    currency_id: base.EUR
    invoice_line:
      - account_id: account.a_expense
        name: 'Some contact lenses'
        price_unit: 600.00
        quantity: 1.0
    journal_id: account.expenses_journal
-
  Make sure that the type is in_invoice
-
  !python {model: account.invoice}: |
    self.write(cr, uid, ref("account_invoice_supplier_refunded"), {'type': 'in_invoice'})
-
  I change the state of invoice to open by clicking Validate button
-
  !workflow {model: account.invoice, action: invoice_open, ref: account_invoice_supplier_refunded}
-
  I create a supplier refund for this invoice
-
  !record {model: account.invoice, id: account_refund_supplier_refunded, view: account.invoice_supplier_form}:
    check_total: 200.00
    partner_id: base.res_partner_12
    reference_type: none
    type: in_refund
    account_id: account.a_pay
    company_id: base.main_company
    currency_id: base.EUR
    invoice_line:
      - account_id: account.a_expense
        name: 'Some contact lenses'
        price_unit: 200.00
        quantity: 1.0
    journal_id: account.expenses_journal
-
  Make sure that the type is in_invoice
-
  !python {model: account.invoice}: |
    self.write(cr, uid, ref("account_refund_supplier_refunded"), {'type': 'in_refund'})
-
  I change the state of invoice to open by clicking Validate button
-
  !workflow {model: account.invoice, action: invoice_open, ref: account_refund_supplier_refunded}
-
  I reconcile the invoice and the refund
-
  !record {model: account.move.line.reconcile, id: account_move_line_reconcile0}:
    trans_nbr: 2
    credit: 600.0
    debit: 200.0
    writeoff: -400.0
-
  Then I click on the 'Partial Reconcile' button
-
  !python {model: account.move.line.reconcile}: |
    move_line_obj = self.pool.get('account.move.line')
    inv_obj = self.pool.get('account.invoice')
    invoice_move_id = inv_obj.browse(cr, uid, ref("account_invoice_supplier_refunded")).move_id.id
    refund_move_id = inv_obj.browse(cr, uid, ref("account_refund_supplier_refunded")).move_id.id
    debit_line_id = move_line_obj.search(cr, uid, [('move_id', '=', refund_move_id),('debit', '=', 200)])[0]
    credit_line_id = move_line_obj.search(cr, uid, [('move_id', '=', invoice_move_id),('credit', '=', 600)])[0]
    ids = [debit_line_id, credit_line_id]
    partial_reconcile = self.trans_rec_reconcile_partial_reconcile(cr, uid, [ref('account_move_line_reconcile0')], {
    'active_model': 'account.move.line', 'active_ids': ids, 'tz': False, 'active_id': ids[1]})
    move_line = move_line_obj.browse(cr, uid, ids)
    assert move_line[0].reconcile_partial_id, "Partial reconcilation is not done"
-
  I check that the invoice balance (residual) is now 400
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_supplier_refunded, severity: error, string: Invoice residual should be 400.}:
    - residual == 400
    - amount_total == 600
-
  I create a payment order on which I will select the invoice I created
-
  !record {model: payment.order, id: partial_payment_order_1}:
    mode: account_banking_payment_transfer.payment_mode0
    date_prefered: 'due'
-
  !record {model: payment.order.create, id: payment_order_create_1}:
    duedate: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
-
  I search for the invoice entries to make the payment.
-
  !python {model: payment.order.create}: |
    self.search_entries(cr, uid, [ref("payment_order_create_1")], {
      "active_model": "payment.order", "active_ids": [ref("partial_payment_order_1")],
      "active_id": ref("partial_payment_order_1"), })
-
  I create payment lines entries.
-
  !python {model: payment.order.create}: |
    invoice = self.pool.get('account.invoice').browse(cr, uid, ref("account_invoice_supplier_refunded"))
    for l in invoice.move_id.line_id:
        if not l.debit and l.credit:
            move_line = l
            break
    self.write(cr, uid, [ref("payment_order_create_1")], {'entries': [(6,0,[move_line.id])]})
    self.create_payment(cr, uid, [ref("payment_order_create_1")], {
      "active_model": "payment.order", "active_ids": [ref("partial_payment_order_1")],
      "active_id": ref("partial_payment_order_1")})
    pay_obj = self.pool.get('payment.order')
    pay = pay_obj.browse(cr, uid, ref('partial_payment_order_1'))
    assert pay.line_ids[0].amount_currency == 400
    assert pay.total == 400
-
  I confirm the payment order.
-
  !workflow {model: payment.order, action: open, ref: partial_payment_order_1}
-
  I check that payment order is now "Confirmed".
-
  !assert {model: payment.order, id: partial_payment_order_1, severity: error, string: Payment Order should be 'Confirmed'.}:
    - state == 'open'
-
  I create the wizard for paying the payment
-
  !record {model: payment.manual, id: payment_manual_partial}:
    create_date: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
-
  I click OK
-
  !python {model: payment.manual}: |
    if context is None:
      context = {}
    context.update({'active_ids': [ref("partial_payment_order_1")]})
    self.button_ok(cr, uid, ref("payment_manual_partial"), context)
-
  I check that the payment order is now "Sent".
-
  !assert {model: payment.order, id: partial_payment_order_1, severity: error, string: Payment Order should be 'Sent'.}:
    - state == 'sent'
-
  I check that the invoice has payments associated
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_supplier_refunded, severity: error, string: payment_ids should be populated}:
    - payment_ids
-
  I check the content of the payment of the invoice
-
  !python {model: account.invoice}: |
    inv = self.browse(cr, uid, ref("account_invoice_supplier_refunded"))
    payment1, payment2 = sorted(inv.payment_ids, key=lambda line: line.id)
    assert payment1.debit == 200
    assert payment2.debit == 400
    assert inv.payment_ids[0].reconcile_id.id != False
-
  I check that the invoice balance (residual) is now 0 and the state is paid
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: account_invoice_supplier_refunded, severity: error, string: Invoice residual should be 0.}:
    - residual == 0
    - amount_total == 600
    - state == 'paid'
